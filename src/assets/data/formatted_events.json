Advances are made by Government through its native servants, and if a ryot refuses the advance, \u2018the simple plan of throwing the rupees into his house is adopted; should he attempt to abscond, the peons seize him, tie the advance up in his clothes, and push him into his house. The business being now settled, and there being no remedy, he applies himself, as he may, to the fulfilment of his contract\u2026\u2019* The evils which the cultivation of opium entails upon our fellow-subjects in India, arise partly from the ryots in the opium districts of Patna and Benares being compelled to give up fixed portions of their lands for the production of the poppy."

A leader in The Times expressed great regret that \u201cthe Viceroy should have interposed to repress the impulses of private charity\u201d and denounced his policy of pursuing famine relief \u201csolely with economy in mind\u201d. Lord Lytton was eventually forced to sanction the existence of the relief fund and to donate Rupees 10,000 (\u00a31,000) himself, a gesture he admitted privately he made with \u201can ill will\u201d. The fund, which eventually totalled \u00a3820,000, was raised through millions of small contributions from individuals, schools, churches and regiments throughout the British world. However, until December 1877, Lytton continued to describe the fund as \u201ca complete nuisance\u201d and to issue dire warnings that all the money would be wasted by an irresponsible committee.\u2019"

The two biggest consumers of steel in India, the government and the railways (both controlled by the British) insisted on British Standard Specification Steel (BSSS), which was of much higher quality than the Non-British Standard Specification Steel (NBSSS) used by most of the rest of the world. The requirement for BSSS was originally designed to exclude cheaper continental steel from the colonial Indian market, but it also served to hamper Indian steelmakers. Domestic producers of steel in India, such as Tata, were forced to meet these higher standards or be excluded from contracts with the government and railways.\nBy focusing on producing BSSS, as required by law, Indian firms could not simultaneously produce the cheaper NBSSS that was used throughout most of the non-British world. The high cost base of India\u2019s domestic production as a result of BSSS production rendered Indian steel uncompetitive in the wider international market, both during the Great Depression and the late 1930s recovery. Other developing countries in a comparable situation to India in the 1930s developed their steel industries using NBSSS without major problems."
