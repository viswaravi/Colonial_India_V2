            It all began with the East India Company, incorporated by royal
            charter from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth I in 1600 to <br />
            trade in silk and spices, and other profitable Indian commodities.
            Ended with partition of India in different states as <br />
            India , Pakistan, Bangladesh. This part of visualisation shows a
            chronological order of how famous people (Britishers & <br />

            was part of the rule? And how stratigically the events <br />
            took place which lead to this decline?
